Love maths!

In this post I want to cover the following:
- what's category theory - absolute basics
    - explain actual definition. Explain it's like reasoning about relations and transformations between sets (cateogries) 
    rather than elements of sets: when you think of multiplication 
    you don't necessarily think of numbers you want to multiply, e.g. you can imagine if x and y belong to negative numbers category
    then you can figure x * y will always belong to positive numbers category - you dont need to know exactly the numbers 
    - can compose (going from x -> d -> f)
- what's functional programming
    - think of code like algebra, you wouldn't expect side effects from 1 + 1
    - don't mutate any state (like in algebra x = 1 and y = 5 you know x + y is always 6. If you mutate then its not deterministic
    and will cause problems)
    - separate data from functions (like in category theory nodes and functors)
    - compose your functions
- why is functional programming on hype now
    - multicore processors
    - parallism works well with immutability and associativity
